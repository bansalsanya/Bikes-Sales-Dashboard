# Bikes-Sales-Dashboard
This repository features an interactive Bike Sales Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel, designed to analyze sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance. The project includes a comprehensive data cleaning process, where missing values were handled, duplicates removed, and data formatted for consistency using Excel functions like IF, VLOOKUP, and TEXT. The dashboard leverages Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, and Conditional Formatting to create dynamic visualizations, allowing users to explore sales by region, customer type, and product category. With interactive filters and automated calculations, this dashboard provides valuable insights for data-driven decision-making. Future enhancements include integrating Power Query for automation and expanding to Power BI or Tableau for advanced analytics.
